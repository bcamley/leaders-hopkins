Does analysis of a data file to generate the summary data. Expects an argument for the size of the cluster.

'python analysis.py 50' will analyze a data file of 50 cells.

Within the script are functions for the load and save directory - by default this expects a file "data.nc" in the RunSimulation directory, which will be generated by running the run_simulation.py script. These depend on how the filesystem has been setup, and the script can easily be modified to loop through different gradient parameters to analyze many runs.
