The jupyter notebook Generate_Figures.ipynb will generate the figures in the paper from the simulation data.

It requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib and netcdf4-python.

Selecting "Run All" from the Cell menu should populate the Figs folder with all of the figures from the main paper and appendix (except for the illustration of the geometry of the compact clusters)
